# Invoke Plugin for Pylint
This is a plugin for pylint which disables certain checks when using invoke.

## Installation
`pip install invoke-plugin-for-pylint`, that's it.

## Usage
Add `invoke_plugin_for_pylint` to the list of pylint plugins.

## Disabled check

* unused-argument: Each invoke task needs a context argument even if not needed.
  Therefore this plugin will find all tasks and suppress all `unused-argument` errors when related to the context argument


## Configuration

If custom decorators for invoke tasks are used which wrap `invoke.task` the
`additional-invoke-task-decorators` option by checker `invoke-plugin-for-pylint` can be used.
It's a csv list of names which indicate an invoke task.

Please note, that the names must be full qualified and reflect the name of the final function.
For example, a decorator factory called "foo" in package "bar" which returns a function called
"_inner", will result in the name "bar.foo._inner".

Example for the pyproject.toml:

```toml
[tool.pylint.invoke-plugin-for-pylint]
additional-invoke-task-decorators = [
    "my_package.foo.make_task._inner",
    "my_package.foo.make_other_task",
]
```
